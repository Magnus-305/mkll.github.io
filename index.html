            <h4>What is robotics?</h4>
            <p>Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. Robots are programmable machines that can carry out tasks either automatically or under human control. They combine mechanical engineering, electrical systems, and computer science to solve real-world problems in industries like healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, space exploration, and even at home!</p>
